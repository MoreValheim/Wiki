Workbench is a buildable [object](../../objects/) found in Valheim.

The workbench is used for crafting and building.

If you want to craft with the workbench, you need to build a roof over it and in an enclosed area. However the workbench can be used with the [hammer](../../items/hammer) without a roof.

Most [objects](../../objects) in the game need to have a workbench within proximity to be placed and/or used.

The workbench can also be used to disable [enemy](../../creatures#hostile) spawns in its area of effect.

#### How to build:

You need to have a [workbench](../../objects/workbench) nearby in order to construct a workbench.

1. Equip your [hammer](../../items/hammer)
2. Right-click
3. Press [Q/E] to switch to the [Crafting tab](../../misc/building_interface#crafting_tab) of the [building interface](../../misc/building_interface)
4. Left-click the workbench on the displayed page
5. Left-click to place down

### Upgrades

In order to upgrade your equipment and craft new items, it is needed to upgrade your workbench level first. For that you can place the following buildings close to the workbench you want to upgrade:

* [Chopping Block](../../objects/chopping_block)
* [Tanning Rack](../../objects/tanning_rack)
* [Adze](../../objects/adze)
* [Tool Shelf](../../objects/tool_shelf)

Adding any of these listed items within the building range of the workbench, the level of the workbench will go up by one. The order does not matter, and all act as a +1 bonus to the level. These building can be found in the same submenu "Crafting" of the Hammer.
